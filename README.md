## Built-in Data Structures

 - List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set
 Lists are mutable(changable)
a =[]
a.append(stuff)

tuples are same as lists except it is not mutable
c = (1,2,3)

dictionary : key-value pairs
d = {}
d['1'] = 2

Sets are a collection of unordered elements that are unique
u can perform union, intersection etc on sets
e = {2,3,4,5}

## User Defined Data Structures

 - stack, Queue, Tree, LinkedList, Graph, Hashmaps

 stack : Linear data structure (last in first out)
 push,pop,access from the top
 used in recursive programming, reversing words, undo mechanisms in word editors and so forth

 queues : linear data structure (first in first out)
 operations can be performed from both ends of the queue(head-tail/front-back)
 the operation of adding and deleting element is called nqueue and dequeue
 used as network buffers for traffic conjestion management, job scheduling etc.

 trees : non-linear data structures with roots and nodes. last nodes -> leaves.
 used in html pages, search operations etc.

 linked list : linear data structures (image viewing application)

 graphs : data collection of points containing vertices and edges
 used to find cost effective paths between nodes(google maps, uber uses graphs)

 hashmaps: same as dictionaries in python

## Algorithms

 - Divide and conquer
 - Dynamic programming
 - Greedy algorithms

## Tree traversal

- Pre-order
- Post-order
- In-order : Visit the left node->root->right node

## Sorting algorithms

- Merge sort : Follows the divide and conquer rule. The given list is first divided into smaller lists and compares adjacent lists and then reorders them in the desired sequence.

## Time complexity

## Binary search : Look at the middle element. It only works if the data is sorted.

## Hash tables
Data lookup by key

In-place Array operations help to reduce space complexity
